CKEditor Browser Context Menu

This module disables CKEditor own context menu (right-click popup menu) and allows the Browser's own context menu to display normally. This will allow users to use the browser's built-in spell checker, autocorrect and other built-in options.

NOTE 1: This is done by disabling the contextmenu, tabletools, and tableresize plugins. If you need these functions, do not install this module.

NOTE 2: There may be options in the browser's context menu that may not be handled properly within the CKEditor editor. Test these browser context menu options before relying on them.
