# Blog template
A simple blog project created using rails. Originally intended to be a blog for my sister, I enjoyed working on it and decided to make it as a template for other blogs to make. 

## Running it on your machine
Be aware that you will need Ruby and Rails to be installed on your machine to run this app, also it is not advised to run this on a windows machine.
To run the blog on your machine, clone this repository, navigate to the folder where you cloned it and on the terminal run the command
```
$ rails server
```
the blog will be available to be seen on the address http://localhost:3000/ on any browser.

Right now the blog should register new posts, upload pictures, let the admin log in. New features will be implemented soon.
